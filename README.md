# About
This simple webpage can be used in your intranet for converting PDF files without relying on external sites or paid software.

It provides two services:
* merging PDFs
* converting PDF to CSV (experimental, quality depends on how the PDF was built)
  
# ToDos
- As usual: refactor!

# Installing
- Use a LAMP with Poppler-Tools.
- Create log and uploads folders, make them writable for your webserver.
- Create your own etc/globals.php from the template
- Upload a company logo

# Usage
Just upload one or more files and hit the merge/convert button.
